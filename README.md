# ProgrammingLangConceptProject

A project made in my Programming Languages Concepts. The SimpleCalc.g4 file is where the rules of the program is contained. 
The AnalysisListener.java is further programming of the language to better understand the input, and interpret the input if
the input is not consistent.
